# ðŸ“˜ Day 18 â€“ Polynomial Factoring

ðŸ§  Today I practiced factoring polynomials using SymPy:
- Extracted common factors
- Factored quadratic trinomials and special identities
- Solved cubic difference of cubes
- Verified factored and expanded forms match
- Visualized both forms on a graph for understanding

Factoring is essential for simplifying algebra and solving equations efficiently.
