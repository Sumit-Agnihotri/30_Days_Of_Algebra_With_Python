# ğŸ“˜ Day 14 â€“ Solving and Graphing Inequalities

ğŸ§  Today I worked on understanding and solving algebraic inequalities:
- Linear (`x + 2 > 5`)
- Quadratic (`xÂ² - 4 < 0`)
- Compound (`2 < x â‰¤ 5`)

âœ… Used SymPy to solve inequalities analytically  
âœ… Visualized linear inequality solutions with shaded regions  
âœ… Took user-defined inequalities as input and solved them dynamically

These concepts are powerful in real-world logic, machine learning models, and data filtering conditions.
