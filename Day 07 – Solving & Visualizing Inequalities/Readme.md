# 📘 Day 07 – Inequalities & Visualization

🎯 Goal:
- Learn how to solve inequalities (> < ≥ ≤)
- Understand compound inequalities like 3 < 2x + 1 < 9
- Use Python’s SymPy to solve them
- Bonus: Visualize inequalities on number line using Matplotlib

| # | Type           | What it solves                  |
|---|----------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | Basic          | x + 3 < 10                      |
| 2 | With ≥         | 2x - 5 ≥ 9                      |
| 3 | Compound       | 3 < 2x + 1 < 9                  |
| 4 | User input     | Let user enter any inequality   |
| 5 | Visualization  | Show inequality on number line  |

You're now not just solving equations — you're solving **ranges**, and **seeing** them with your eyes. 🔍📈
