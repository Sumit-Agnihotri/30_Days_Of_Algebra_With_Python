# ðŸ“˜ Day 16 â€“ Introduction to Polynomials

ðŸ§  Today I learned the foundations of polynomials in Python:
- Represented expressions like 3xÂ² + 2x - 5 using `sympy.Poly`
- Extracted coefficients and degree
- Evaluated polynomials at specific values
- Performed addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials
- Visualized polynomial graphs using `lambdify` and `matplotlib`

Polynomials form the core of algebra and are essential in ML, physics, and symbolic computation.
