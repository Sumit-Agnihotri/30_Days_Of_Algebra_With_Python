# ðŸ“˜ Day 17 â€“ Polynomial Division

ðŸ§  Today I learned how to:
- Perform polynomial division using SymPy's `.div()`, `.quo()`, and `.rem()`
- Extract quotient and remainder from two polynomials
- Validate division identity: dividend = quotient Ã— divisor + remainder
- Visualize the polynomial and its quotient on a graph

Polynomial division helps in simplification, factoring, and algebraic manipulation across data science and calculus!
