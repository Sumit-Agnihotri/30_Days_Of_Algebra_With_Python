# ðŸ“˜ Day 26 â€“ Discriminant and Nature of Roots

âœ… Todayâ€™s Goals:
- Learn the discriminant formula: D = bÂ² - 4ac
- Classify roots (real, repeated, complex)
- Solve quadratics using SymPy
- Visualize quadratic graphs with Matplotlib

The discriminant is a powerful shortcut in algebra â€” giving you root types **before even solving** the equation!
