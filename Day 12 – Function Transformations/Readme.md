# 📘 Day 12 – Function Transformations

🎯 In this lesson, I learned to reshape graphs using transformations:
- 🔼 Shifted graphs up/down with +C
- ▶️ Shifted left/right using (x ± C)
- 🔁 Reflected across x/y-axis
- 🔍 Stretched or compressed functions

All transformations were done on f(x) = x² and plotted with Matplotlib.

These are essential skills in math modeling and machine learning feature transformations!
