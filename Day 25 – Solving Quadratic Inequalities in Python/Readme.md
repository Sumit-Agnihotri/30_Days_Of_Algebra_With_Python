# ðŸ“˜ Day 25 â€“ Solving Quadratic Inequalities

âœ… Todayâ€™s Highlights:
- Used SymPy to solve quadratic inequalities like \( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 \)
- Practiced graphing inequality regions
- Solved real-world inequality using area constraints
- Understood how sign of quadratic changes over intervals

Quadratic inequalities are powerful when modeling **profit, area, risk zones, and constraints**.
