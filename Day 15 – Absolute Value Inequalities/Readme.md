# ðŸ“˜ Day 15 â€“ Absolute Value Inequalities

ðŸ§  Today I worked with inequalities involving absolute values:
- âœ… Solved expressions like `|x| < 4`, `|x - 2| > 3`
- âœ… Understood how absolute inequalities split into compound inequalities
- âœ… Visualized solution intervals using Python & Matplotlib

These are extremely useful in optimization problems, ranges, and modeling real-world uncertainty.
