## ðŸ§  Challenges:

| # | File | What it does |
|---|------|--------------|
| 1 | challenge1.py | Just print a math expression |
| 2 | challenge2.py | Use variables and print the result |
| 3 | challenge3.py | Let user enter values for x and y |
| 4 | challenge4.py | Make a function for 2x + 3y |
| 5 | challenge5.py | Solve 2x + 3 = 13 using sympy |

ðŸ“Œ These are easy enough for **anyone**, even with no coding background.  
Just run each `.py` file to see how math becomes code!
