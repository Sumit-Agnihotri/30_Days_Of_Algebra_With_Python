# 📘 Day 13 – Piecewise Functions

🧠 Piecewise functions behave differently based on input values.  
They are super useful in real-world logic like tax slabs, billing, and conditions.

✅ I created and plotted piecewise functions using:
- Numpy's `where` and `piecewise`
- SymPy's `Piecewise` class
- User input + dynamic expressions

Visualizing the “rule switch” at certain x-points helped me understand conditional math better.
